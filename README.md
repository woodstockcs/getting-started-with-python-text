### Part 2: Exploration
1. Open up the [cs50 IDE](https://ide.cs50.io).
1. Use `cd ~` to get to your root directory.
1. Make a new directory called `unit_5`.
1. `cd` into that directory
1. Make a new file called `first.py`.
1. Open that file.
1. Grab one of the packets called "Packet: Getting Started with Python", which looks like [this](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6wBwD0pwox6b09YbmdNdVVXNGViYmZ1WHZLbkVzb05MWXZj/view?usp=sharing).
1. Work on that packet, writing all the mentioned code in your new file, and running the file when you need to by using `python first.py`. IMPORTANT: As you move along in the packet, comment out code that you don't need anymore, **don't delete it**! When you are done with the packet, you file should contain all of the code mentioned in the packet.
1. When the packet tells you to write code in "the interpreter", go to the command line and just type `python`. This will give you a `>>>` prompt, using `exit()` to get out the python interpreter and back to the regular command prompt.

### Part 3: Mastery Check
1. Go back to this assignment in the google classroom and open up the attachment called "Assignment Wrap-Up Questions", copy/pasting a screenshot of the code you wrote for this assignment.
1. Answer the questions then press 'Turn in'.
